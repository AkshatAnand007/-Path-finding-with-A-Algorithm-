The A* algorithm is a powerful pathfinding technique used in AI, robotics, and games to find the shortest path efficiently. It balances:

G-cost: Distance from the start node.
H-cost: Estimated cost to the goal.
F-cost: Total cost (f = g + h).
A* intelligently explores paths, ensuring optimality and efficiency while avoiding obstacles. It uses heuristics like Manhattan Distance for accuracy. Widely used in navigation systems, game AI, and robotics, A* remains a top choice for fast and reliable pathfinding.
